# Personal-Projects-Assignments

# Here are some projects I have worked on, both in-class and on my own time. 

# BIOS512
  From my BIOS512 Final in 2023 (listed under 'final_project(1)' in BIOS512 folder), I decided to use my interest in sports to exhibit my use of R packages such as tidyverse, dplyr, and forcats packages to analyze raw data files, organizing, filtering, and analyzing 380 matches from the 2021-2022 Premier League season. I then used different visualization forms of key match statistics from data file. Final Visualization can be seen when opening 'github.dev'.

# INLS541
  For my INLS541 final project in 2024 (listed under 'Analyzing World Economics - Tableau 2024'), I used Tableau to gain insight into predictors that could affect bigger picture economic factors such as GDP. I also visualized economic factors to answer and explain potential cause-and-effect questions.

  From the ‚ÄúWorld Economic Data'' dataset on Kaggle, we are given 5 csv files named corruption.csv (containing the variables of annual_income and corruption_index), cost of living.csv (containing the variables of cost_index, monthly_income, and purchasing_power), richest_countries.csv (containing gdp_per_capita), tourism.csv (containing tourism_in_millions, receipts_in_billions, receipts_per_tourist, percentage_of_gdp), and unemployment.csv, with unemployment_rate. In my project using Tableau, I created 5 visualizations, the first 3 of them being exploratory with 2 ‚Äúfinal‚Äù visualizations that related variables to each other. By producing my exploratory data first, I hoped to gain insight into predictors that could affect bigger picture economic factors such as GDP. 

# Time Management

*IN PROGRESS
‚è∞ Time Management & Productivity Analysis

A data analysis and machine learning project exploring how daily habits‚Äîlike work hours, screen time, and sleep‚Äîimpact productivity.

üìä Overview

- Cleaned and explored a dataset on time management behaviors.
- Engineered features like `sleep_screen_ratio` and `work_leisure_ratio` to improve insights.
- Visualized relationships using scatter plots, line charts, and correlation heatmaps.
- Built predictive models to estimate `Productivity Score` based on daily routines.

üß† Machine Learning



- Random Forest outperformed other models, revealing non-linear relationships.
- Key predictors: work hours, sleep/screen ratio, screen time, and leisure balance.

üìå Key Features

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Model Training & Evaluation
- Residual & Feature Importance Plots

üìÅ Technologies

`Python`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`
